# Canada Tax Pros Mockup Website
This website is not live yet. Like most developers our first website is for our mom. This is for my mom's tax business. I tried my best to be innovative but also fit the brand. This site went through 2 iterations. One that was a little older in web style (index_v0) and a more modern and innovative version. On this version, I am aware of poor responsivity and am working to make the ribbons turn horizontal on a small screen width and fix the tiles on small screen sizes. I left both there to show my process and improvement after a good friend of mine told me that the first one sucked. Check it out and feel free to email me about any thoughts you have about it.
